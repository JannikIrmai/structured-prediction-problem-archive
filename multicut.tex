\section{Multicut}
\label{sec:multicut}

The multicut problem~\cite{chopra1993partition} (also known as correlation clustering~\cite{demaine2006correlation}) is to cluster graph nodes based on edge preferences.

\begin{definition}[Multicut]
Given an undirected weighted graph $G=(V,E,c)$ the multicut problem is to find a partition $\Pi = (\Pi_1,\ldots,\Pi_k)$ such that $\Pi_i \cap \Pi_j = \varnothing$ for $i \neq j$ and $\dot{\cup}_{i\in[k]} \Pi_j = V$ where $k$ is computed as part of the optimization process.
The \emph{cut} $\delta(\Pi_1,\ldots,\Pi_k)$ induced by a decomposition is the subset of those edges that straddle distinct clusters.

The space of all multicuts is denoted as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_G = \left\{ \delta(V_1,\ldots,V_k) : 
\begin{array}{c}
  k \in \N \\
  % V_i \cap V_j = \varnothing \quad \forall i\neq j\\
  V_1 \dot\cup \ldots \dot\cup V_k = V
\end{array} \right\}\,.
\end{equation} 

The minimum cost multicut problem is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:multicut}
  \min_{y \in \mathcal{M}_G} \la c, x \ra\,.
\end{equation} 
\end{definition}

A multicut illustration can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:multicut-illustration}

\subsection{File Format}
The multicut problem is given in the text file format as follows:

\begin{fileformat}
MULTICUT
(*$i_1$*) (*$j_1$*) (*$c_1$*)
.
.
.
(*$i_m$*) (*$j_m$*) (*$c_m$*)
\end{fileformat}
where $E = \{i_1 j_1, \ldots, i_m j_m\}$ and $c_1,\ldots,c_m$ are the corresponding edge weights.

\subsection{Benchmark datasets}

\subsubsection{CREMI}
The CREMI-challenge~\cite{cremi} is to group voxels from 3D-volumes of fruit-fly brain matter together whenever they belong to the same neuron.
The raw image data was acquired by~\cite{zheng2018complete} and converted to multiple multicut instances as detailed below.

\paragraph{Superpixel\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/811b88d4c97644d39ea9/?dl=1}}}
For converting the data into multicut instances the authors of~\cite{pape2017solving} first created super-pixels and then computed affinities between these for estimating probabilities that superpixels belong to the same neuron.
Instances are different crops of one global problem.
There are 3 small ($400000-600000$ edges), 3 medium ($4-5$ million edges) and 5 large ($28-650$ million edges) multicut instances.

\paragraph{Raw\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/3916d2da6aa840139206/?dl=1}}}
Multicut instances are derived directly from the voxel grid without conversion to superpixels.
Three test volumes sample A+, B+ and C+ from~\cite{cremi} were used.
Edge weights are computed by~\cite{torch_EM}.
There are two types of instances:
(i)~The three full problems where the underlying volumes have size $1250 \times 1250 \times 125$ with around $700$ million edges and
(ii)~six cropped problems created by halving each volume and creating the corresponding multicut instances each containing almost $340$ million edges.

\subsubsection[Cityscapes Instance Segmentation]{Cityscapes Instance Segmentation\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/80686a004ff84d96aaeb/?dl=1}}}

Unsupervised image segmentation on $59$ high resolution images ($2048 \times 1024$) taken from the validation set~\cite{cordts2016cityscapes}.
Conversion to multicut instances is done by computing the edge affinities produced by~\cite{abbas2021combinatorial} on a grid graph with $4$-connectivity and additional coarsely sampled longer range edges.
Each instance contains approximately $2$ million nodes and $9$ million edges.
