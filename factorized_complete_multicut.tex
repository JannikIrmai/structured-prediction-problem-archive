\section{Factorized Complete Multicut}
\label{sec:complete_multicut}

\begin{definition}[Factorized Complete Multicut]
    Given a set of nodes $V$ where each node $i \in V$ has a feature vector $f_i \in \R^d$. We consider all possible edges i.e.\ $E = \{ij : i \in V, j \in V\setminus \{i\} \}$. 
    Let $G = (V, E)$ then the factorized complete multicut problem is
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:factorized_complete_multicut}
        \begin{array}{rl}
            \min_{y \in \mathcal{M}_G} \sum\limits_{i \in V} \sum\limits_{j \in V \setminus i} \la f_i, f_j \ra \cdot y_{ij}
        \end{array}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

An illustration of factorized complete multicut is given in Figure~\ref{fig:factorized-complete-multicut}.

    \caption{Example illustration of factorized complete multicut problem on $5$ nodes. Each node $i$ is associated with a vector $f_i \in \R^2$ and all possible edges between distinct nodes are considered (i.e.\ the complete graph). The edge cost between a pair of nodes $i$, $j$ is measured by $\langle f_i, f_j \rangle$ and attractive/repulsive edges are colored green/red. Edge thickness represents absolute edge cost. Also shown is the optimal partitioning to $2$ clusters with cut edges denoted by dashed lines.}

\subsection{Benchmark datasets}

\subsubsection{Imagenet Clustering}
Clustering of the ImageNet~\cite{deng2009imagenet} validation set containing $50k$ images. Each image acts a node for the complete multicut problem. The features have a dimension of $2048$ and are normalized to have unit $L_2$ norm. Two problem instances created by~\cite{aabbas23_clusterfug} are provided containing $5k$ and $50k$ images by considering $100$ and all $1000$ classes respectively. 

\subsubsection{Cityscapes Instance Segmentation}
For the task of instance segmentation on Cityscapes validation set~\cite{cordts2016cityscapes}. For each \textit{thing} class a separate complete multicut problem instance is created at $4$ times downsampled resolution w.r.t.\ the input resolution. 
In total there are $1631$ problem instances computed by~\cite{aabbas23_clusterfug}. The largest problem instance contains around $43k$ nodes. 

\subsection{Algorithms}
For solving the complete multicut problem all algorithms from Section~\ref{sec:multicut} are applicable but can be inefficient for large problems. 
\begin{description}
\item[ClusterFuG~\cite{aabbas23_clusterfug}:] Multiple algorithms based on edge contraction similar to GAEC algorithm for multicut~\cite{keuper2015efficient}. The algorithms make use of nearest neighbour techniques and factorized edge costs structure for efficiency.
